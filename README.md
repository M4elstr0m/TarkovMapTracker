Tarkov Map Tracker is designed to help beginners to find themselves on the huge maps of <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/">Escape From Tarkov</a>
<br>I made this software because I did not find any app that really tracks your location in real time in Tarkov

Don't hesitate to reach me, or donate using the links on <a href="https://github.com/M4elstr0m/">my profile</a>, all donations are appreciated üòâ
<br>

<br>There is no specific rules from Battlestate Games that does'nt allow to use screenshots, but beware if it is the case and please contact me!<br>
**This is not a cheat since it only uses screenshots from the game, but use this software on your own risks if there is a rule about this in the future ‚ö†Ô∏è I'm not responsible of any loss**<br>
## üñ•Ô∏è Platforms
This software is Windows-only<br>
Notice that this software is only helpful when you have Escape From Tarkov installed on your computer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
**Please install Python 3.10 version or higher before installing Tarkov Map Tracker and be sure that you also have "pip" installed**<br>

Command installation (for CLI-Github users):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/M4elstr0m/TarkovMapTracker.git
```

ZIP (Archive) Installation:
1. Just download the repository by clicking on **< > Code** then click on **Download ZIP**
2. Unzip the archive using WinRAR or 7zip for example
3. Keep the folder where you want to store your **Tarkov Map Tracker**

<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è **If you get a missing module error, just type the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the main folder**

<br>

If you don't have **pip** installed yet, just type the command ```py -m ensurepip --upgrade```

## üìö Usage
You just have to double click on "start.exe" (if Windows is blocking you just click on 'More infos' then 'Run anyway')
<br>
‚ö†Ô∏è **If there is not any window showing up**, maybe the problem is from the "start.exe", then you can go in the "_tarkov-map-tracker_" folder and type the following command in a terminal window: ```py gui.py``` or ```python gui.py```
<br>
<br>
- The software is tracking your position using screenshots so you have to take a screenshot and then refresh your map using the Keybind (by default "$") or not, depending on AutoMode state.<br><br>
- The software won't be able to recognize on which map you are automatically (since a screenshot does'nt have this information inside it), you have to choose the right map by yourself.<br><br>
- I suggest you to rebind your Tarkov in-game Screenshot keybind for the same as Keybind in Tarkov Map Tracker (notice that ImpScreen may not work because it triggers the Windows service himself) :  for eg if your in-game key is "M" to do a screenshot, bind the Tarkov Map Tracker with "M" as well.<br><br>

## üîß Setting-up

In the GUI you have 4 types of button:

**Keybind**: You can bind a key to refresh the map (with AutoMode activated, please bind the same key as your in-game Tarkov screenshot key). "$" key by default<br><br>
**AutoMode**: Will refresh the map automatically every 5 seconds, **if the Keybind is the same as Tarkov**, it will also take a screenshot at the same time, so you don't have anything to do but looking at the map.<br><br>
**Delete Screenshots**: This button has to be pressed two times in order to fully clear **all** your Tarkov Screenshot directory.<br> **WHEN DELETED YOU CANNOT RETRIEVE YOUR FILES ANYMORE**<br>

**Maps button**: When you click on the button corresponding to a map, this map opens and either you or the software have to refresh it (depending on AutoMode state)<br><br>

Settings are also accessible from /tarkov-map-tracker/settings.txt
