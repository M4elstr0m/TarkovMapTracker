### ‚ö†Ô∏è <ins>Disclaimer</ins>

**What this app can't do:**
- Access location of in-game elements such as loot or enemies
- Modify your own in-game location

**This is not a cheat since it only uses external stuff of the game, but use this software at your own risk. If there is a rule about this in the future please contact me ‚ö†Ô∏è <ins>Still, I am not responsible of any loss**</ins><br>

## üì¶ Installation
**Please try to start Escape From Tarkov (EFT) at least once before trying this software**<br>

2. Unzip the archive into a folder
3. Keep the folder where you want to store the Tarkov Map Tracker
4. Start the application by double clicking on ***TarkovMapTracker.exe***

<ins>**OR**</ins>

<br>

![image](insert image of GUI)

<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è **The window might display oddly when using multiple monitors. If it is the case, just try to check/uncheck the AutoMode option**

<br>

To display your position correctly, you will have to select among the maps the one you are going to raid.

‚Ä¢ If AutoMode **is checked**: Just start a raid in your previously selected map and take a in-game screenshot, then watch for the red dot that will appear on the Tarkov Map Tracker<br>
‚Ä¢ If AutoMode **is NOT checked**: Start a raid in your previously selected map and take a in-game screenshot, then go on the Tarkov Map Tracker and press the **Locate** button<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Settings

<ins>There are several buttons on the user interface</ins> (see GUI screenshot above):

**Locate**: Locates yourself on the map using your latest screenshot
![image](insert every image of every button)

**Maps**: Allows you to change the current map
![image](insert every image of every button)

**AutoMode**: Checking this will enable the auto-refreshing feature of the software, so the **Locate** button won't be useful anymore
![image](insert every image of every button)

**Speed**: When **AutoMode** is checked, this determines the rate of the **AutoMode** (Fast/Normal/Slow)
![image](insert every image of every button)

**Folder**: Opens the screenshot folder of Escape From Tarkov
![image](insert every image of every button)

**Github**: Opens the webpage of <a href="https://github.com/M4elstr0m/TarkovMapTracker">Tarkov Map Tracker</a>
![image](insert every image of every button)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not modify the settings.ini file manually, or you may have to re-download the TarkovMapTracker**

<h6><ins>To my fellow developers</ins>: You might have noticed that there was a setting "Hotkey" amid the settings.ini file; this is related to a beta feature of the TarkovMapTracker that I will <ins>eventually</ins> add in the future</h6>

## üñ•Ô∏è Platforms
This software is only for **Windows** and is only helpful when you have Escape From Tarkov installed on your computer

## ‚ö°Performance
I previously developed this application in Python, but I decided to recreate it in Golang for performance reasons

Indeed, Golang allows me to manage the computer's resources more efficiently, ensuring that this application does not consume too much memory while running alongside Escape From Tarkov
Based on my tests, the application can take from 80 Mb to 110 Mb of RAM depending on the **Speed** setting, which is good, since players need at least 16 Go of RAM to play the game

## üóíÔ∏è Credits
<a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/">Escape From Tarkov</a>: this software has been made for this game after all
<a href="https://tarkov.dev">Tarkov.dev</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Shebuka">Shebuka</a>: for the maps used in this software and their help to check for potential copyright issues
This software has been created using the following Golang modules: ```fyne/v2```, ```faiface/beep```, ```go-ini/ini```, ```pkg/browser```
