## ‚ö†Ô∏è <ins>Disclaimer</ins>

**What this app can't do:**
- Access location of in-game elements such as loot or enemies
- Modify your own in-game location

**This is not a cheat since it only uses external stuff of the game, but use this software at your own risk. If there is a rule about this in the future please contact me ‚ö†Ô∏è <ins>Still, I am not responsible of any loss**</ins><br>

## üì¶ Installation

Download the [latest](https://github.com/M4elstr0m/TarkovMapTracker/releases/latest) TarkovMapTracker version from the [releases tab](https://github.com/M4elstr0m/TarkovMapTracker/releases)

Don't forget to check [the changelogs](https://github.com/M4elstr0m/TarkovMapTracker/releases/latest) to see what's new!

## üìö Usage
Just extract the archive and launch ***TarkovMapTracker.exe*** (if Windows prevents you to open the app, just click on "More infos" and "Run anyway")

<br>

To display your position correctly, you will have to select among the maps the one you are going to play. To do so, simply press the **Maps** button. Then take an in-game screenshots (using the EFT game hotkey), and that's all!

## üõ†Ô∏è Settings

<details>
<summary><h3>Force Path</h3></summary>

This settings allows you to overwrite the default EFT's screenshots path (`C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Escape from Tarkov`) with a new path. For example if your screenshots are on your Desktop you should put fill this entry with: `C:/Users/USERNAME/Desktop`

Do not input quotes (`"` or `'`), the software handles it automatically.

This feature was implemented as a fix for [this issue](https://github.com/M4elstr0m/TarkovMapTracker/discussions/2).

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Theme</h3></summary>

This settings allows you to choose your own color scheme for this app. In the [v1.0.0](https://github.com/M4elstr0m/TarkovMapTracker/releases/tag/v1.0.0) users were not able to change to something else than the "Dark" theme.

I may add more themes if requested. 

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Map Size</h3></summary>

This settings allows you to resize the map in pixels unit, therefore the whole window. Do not scale it bigger than your monitor :)
</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Icons Size</h3></summary>

These settings allows you to change icons size, like the player or the extracts. I suggest you only to only change player's size if needed but not the others.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Zoom Level</h3></summary>

This settings allows you to zoom-in on your player. This also centers the player at the middle of the screen.

This feature was requested [here](https://github.com/M4elstr0m/TarkovMapTracker/discussions/3)

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Scan Speed</h3></summary>

This settings allows you to change the frequency of window's refresh (if a new position appeared). `60` means that the window will be refreshed each second.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Show Icons Checkmarks</h3></summary>

This settings allows you to display, or not, a category of icons on the map (like extracts, possible loot location). This is greatly inspired by Tarkov.dev
